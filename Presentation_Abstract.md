The scoring system in tennis allows for abrupt changes of momentum in short amounts of time. We are interested in exploring the probability of tennis players winning a match by combining data from prior matches with points played in the current match of interest. The probability of winning a match is a function of the probability of winning a point on serve and the current point, game, and set score in the match. A Bayesian model can combine points played by a player in previous matches with points played in the current match. As case studies, we explore (1) the 2022 US Open Men's Quarterfinal match between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, where Alcaraz won in 5 sets and (2) the 2023 US Open Women's Final between Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka, where Gauff won in 3 sets.
